# RSA from Temu

Hello, I have found a plasticized piece of paper flying on the street near the
French street... It has some numbers written on it, but I cannot make much
of these.

It looks like a RSA-encrypted message, but we only have the public key and a
weird "dp"...

Unfortunately, it appears that the last part of the paper is missing... 

Oh, there was something else handwritten in a corner:
"CROISSANT" (huh??) ... ends with "BAGUETTE"!

Hints:
  * IACR 2004/147!
  * to verify decryption's success, the flag must contain "that" french word ;)
    the other one is also important!
