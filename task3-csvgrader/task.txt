# CSV Grader

Finally, we managed to steal our Cyber-Security teacher's proprietary grading
program.

It is said he hosts it on a public-facing server:
isc2025.root.sx:12036

See if you can exploit it and fetch "the flag" to enhance our grades!

Hints:
  * optional: decompile using Ghidra
  * ez stack overflow + ROP!
  * if you manage to retrieve fake flag, try it on remote host!
