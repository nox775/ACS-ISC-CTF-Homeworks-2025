# Minishell

Welcome to CyberBalance Financial Group! As a newly hired accountant, your
first job will be to manage our financial documents.

For this, we have built an internal Document Management Shell (DMS) to handle
document storage, processing, and compliance reporting in a centralized fashion.

You've been granted access to a restricted mini-shell on our document server,
please find your public / private key pair attached.

Also note that any tentative unauthorized access will be logged!
Not that we consider our service to be insecure... in fact, it has been
thoroughly audited by experts!

Now... let's get to work!

Hints:
  * traverse your way to the real shell!
  * check shell history for paths?
  * shebang troubles you? try to fool him to give you an interactive shell...
  * find the flag ;)
  * ?? => elevate your privileges even further (suid audit)!
