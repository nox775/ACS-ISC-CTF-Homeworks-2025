# IoT pub/sub service

Dear SuppaHacker,

We've just started coding our own micro IoT platform using the publish/subscribe paradigm.

I'm sending you the binary + some sample code.

When you finally decied to test our production server, here's the address:
isc2025.root.sx:10015

Looking for an expert's opinion, so please tell us if you find anything out of place.

Regards,
Unbreakable Protocols Ltd.


Hints:
  * you received all attachments, right?
  * you must use some automation scripts on this (try `pwntools`!);
  * as you will see, this task is actually DEAD SERIOUS and shall not be taken lightly!
  * find function pointer to overflow (hint: DATA)!
  * more problems arise: ROP chain must reside on stack... but how to chain them together...? 
  * if you manage to retrieve fake flag, try it on remote host!
